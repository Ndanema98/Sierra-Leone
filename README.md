# Sierra Leone - The History & Facts
["Sierra Leone - The History & Facts"](https://ndanema98.github.io/Sierra-Leone/index.html) is a website designed to educate people of all ages on Sierra Leone.  

Users of this website will be able to further their knowledge on Sierra Leone, through the key facts and historical timeline section. The competition section also allows a lucky user to win a free trip to Sierra Leone. 

This website was targetted at people who wanted to gain a better understanding of Sierra Leone's history and facts. 

This website was built using knowledge gained from HTML and CSS modules, for the purpose of completing my first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's full stack developer course.

 # Features
 - ## Navigation 
   - The website name at the top left of the screen has a link that navigates to the home page when clicked. 
   - The other navigation links are at the top right of the screen. These are the "home", "gallery" and "competition time" links and when clicked, take you to thier respective pages. 
   - The navigation bar's font and colour vary from the rest of the page so the user can easily identify it. 
   - Due to the navigation element, the different sections of information are easier to locate.

 - ## The Hero Section 
   - This section has an opening statement which breifly gives some information about Sierra Leone. It explains the location of Sierra Leone and it's climate environment. 
   - The colour scheme for my project is green, white and blue; which is the same colours of the Sierra Leone flag. Due to this I have made the heading green and the text for this section white. 
   - The zoom element has also been added to the background image, to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
