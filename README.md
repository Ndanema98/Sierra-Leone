# Sierra Leone - The History & Facts
["Sierra Leone - The History & Facts"](https://ndanema98.github.io/Sierra-Leone/index.html) is a website designed to educate people of all ages on Sierra Leone.  

Users of this website will be able to further their knowledge on Sierra Leone, through the key facts and historical timeline section. The competition section also allows a lucky user to win a free trip to Sierra Leone. 

This website was targetted at people who wanted to gain a better understanding of Sierra Leone's history and facts. 

This website was built using knowledge gained from HTML and CSS modules, for the purpose of completing my first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's full stack developer course.
